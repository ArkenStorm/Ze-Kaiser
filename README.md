# Ze-Kaiser-2.0
A Discord bot, mainly for the BYU CS and eSports servers.

This is an expansion of an already existing discord bot that mainly serves as an administrative helper.
The idea behind this project is to add functionality for event scheduling, configurable help commands, and configurable conveniences on a per-server basis.
